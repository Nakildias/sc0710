# sc0710
Elgato 4K60 Pro mk.2 capture card driver for linux. Tested on kernel 6.18.3-arch1-1
Improvement over the original drivers
1. Actually compiles
2. Multi-Application (Capture Card works on multiple apps at the same time)
3. Can survive a HDMI unplug and replug without crashing the kernel
4. Will have some support if you have issues please open an issue about it
