# sc0710
Elgato 4K60 Pro mk.2 capture card driver for linux. Tested on kernel 6.18.3-arch1-1
Improvement over the original drivers
1. Actually compiles
2. Multi-Application (Capture Card works on multiple apps at the same time)
3. Can survive a HDMI unplug and replug without crashing the kernel
4. Will have some support if you have issues please open an issue about it
5. Display is correct upon disconection and reconection of the HDMI cable. (IDK IF the original had this issue as I never were able to even compile it as my Kernel is too recent for it.)


Please note that this is orginally the the work of
